# 📊 MySQL Tasks

Welcome to the **MySQL Tasks** repository!  
This repo is a collection of MySQL query assignments and tasks that I’ve completed while learning SQL. All tasks were solved using **MySQL Workbench**.

These exercises are based on the structured and beginner-friendly lessons by **Nitish Sir** from the [CampusX YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/CampusX).

## 📚 What's Inside

- ✅ Basic SELECT Queries  
- 🔄 Filtering with WHERE Clauses

- 📌 GROUP BY & HAVING Clauses  
- 🔗 JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)  
- 🧩 Subqueries  
- 🪟 Window Functions (RANK, ROW_NUMBER, PARTITION BY, etc.)

Each query is written, tested, and explained for easy understanding and practice.
